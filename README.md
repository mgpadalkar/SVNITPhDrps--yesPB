(Option added to start new chapter on odd page,
a contribution by Brijesh B. Mehta)

version : 15.04.22



The main template file is "PhDrps-templatePB.tex" which uses the provided class file "SVNITPhDrpsPB.cls".

The folder contains may .sty files which are used in the template.

For correct pageborders, one should use latex->ps->pdf compilation option.

Thanks :-)
